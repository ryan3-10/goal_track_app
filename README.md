This app can be used to create measurable goals (example: read for 1 hour per day). 

Set a title, type (daily, weekly, or monthly), and a target number of hours for your goal. Whenever you are working on the goal, start a session and the app will keep track of how much time you spend working on the goal. 
At the end of a cycle (every day, week, or month depending on the goal type), the time counter will automatically reset, and "post" your goal, labeling it as either a "pass" or a "fail" based on whether or not you reached your target number of hours.
